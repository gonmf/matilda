/*
A cfg_board structure is a common fate graph board representation that is used
for fast atari checking; because of this it is useful specially in heavy
playouts.

A cfg_board is built from a previous board structure, but the two are not
linked; i.e. changes in one don't reflect in the other.

Building and destroying (freeing) a cfg_board are costly operations that should
be used only if the cfg_board will be used in playing many turns. cfg_board
structures are partially dynamically created and as such cannot be simply
memcpied to reuse the same starting game point. Undo is also not supported.

Freed cfg_board information is kept in cache for fast access in the future; it
is best to first free previous instances before creating new ones, thus limiting
the size the cache has to have.

Just like in the rest of the source code, all functions are not thread unless
explicitly said so.
