This directory is used for every file read/write operation of Matilda.
Due to security concerns (like remotely reading SGF files) it is not possible to
specify reading or writing outside it.

This is the place to put all pre-compiled files, like pattern databases and
opening books. SGF files for pattern collection should also be located somewhere
in this directory.

You can override the location of this directory with the --data flag.

The files recognized by Matilda are:
- *.sgf - SGF file. To read a SGF file it has to have this extension. SGF files
    that do not specify the board size will have it guessed automatically, which
    can fail, causing the file to not be loaded.

- NxN.ob - Opening book in text/Fuego-style format. Rules that are read first
    have precedence over later appearances.

- *.pat3 - Text file with 3x3 patterns centered on a promising play.

- NxN.weights - Text file with pattern weights. These two do not have to agree
    on the patterns contained.

- NxN.zt - Binary file with pre-generated Zobrist 64-bit tables.

- *.log - Text file used for event logging. Created by default in the working
    directory.

- *.pts - Text file with lists of points used for handicap, hoshi and other
    stone placement. Similar in format to .ob files.
