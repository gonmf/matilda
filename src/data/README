This directory is used for every file read/write operation of Matilda.
Due to security concerns (like remotely reading SGF files) it is not possible to
specify reading or writing outside it.

This is the place to put all pre-compiled files, like pattern databases and
opening books. SGF files for pattern collection should also be located somewhere
in this directory.

You can override the location of this directory with the --data flag.

The files recognized by Matilda are:
- *.sgf - SGF file. To read a SGF file it has to have this extension. SGF files
    that do not specify the board size will have it guessed automatically, which
    can fail, causing the file to not be loaded.

- *.ob - Opening book in text/Fuego-style format. Matilda will read any that it
    finds. Repeated rules are ignored.

- *.spb - State->play book in text format. These contain the entire board
    contents and not just a sequence of alternated play like an .ob file.
    Matilda will read any that it finds. Repeated rules, format errors, etc are
    ignored.

- *.joseki - Joseki dictionary in text format. Matilda will read any that it
    finds. Repeated patterns are ignored.

- *.pat3 - Text file with 3x3 patterns centered on a promising play.

- NxN.weights - Text file with pattern weights. These two do not have to agree
    on the patterns contained.

- NxN.zt - Binary file with pre-generated Zobrist 64-bit tables.

- *.log - Text file used for event logging. Created by default in the working
    directory.

- .pts - Text file with lists of points used for handicap, hoshi and other stone
    placement. Similar in format to .ob files.
