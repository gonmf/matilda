Application for training neural networks with a training set


This application consumes a previously generated training set extracted
from high quality Go games. The training set examples should be:

- Unique
- Contain relevant information besides the stone positions, like
    captures for ko testing.
- Use Chinese ruleset
- Right board size
- No stone handicap
- The best play not being a pass
