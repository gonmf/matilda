Application for extracting a training set of unique Go play cases


This application consumes SGF files from the data folder and produces a training
set file (.ds) in the same folder. The cases are unique; always from the black
players point of view. Every example is reduced: rotated and flipped to catch
similar states and thus reduce repeated information in the resulting data set
file, which will already be large in size. Every example already codifies
illegal intersections and number of liberties after playing at each empty
intersection.

A training set file consists of 4 bytes with the number of entries in the
training set, followed by the entries in binary form.

Please avoid feeding SGF files of the wrong board size, ruleset, etc since the
application might not be able to catch all possible exceptions. Only matches
with Chinese rules and no handicap stones currently are used. Passes are also
ignored.
