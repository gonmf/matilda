GTP MODIFICATIONS IN MATILDA

This file documents the changes to GTP 2 draft 2 commands as implemented, plus
the private command extensions supported.

1. Standard Commands

Reference: http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html

boardsize -- the command fails if the board size requested is different than the
value set at compile time. Furthermore, if no argument is given the command
succeeds and returns the current board size.


komi -- the command also accepts no parameters, returning the current komidashi.


loadsgf -- the command fails if the game board size requested is different than
the value set at compile time.


final_status_list -- Matilda may prefer playing to passing and, as such, kill
dead groups; when answering this command it will always mark all stones as
alive, not identifying life in seki.
