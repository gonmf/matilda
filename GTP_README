This file documents the changes to GTP 2 draft 2 commands as implemented, plus
the private command extensions supported.

1. Standard Commands

boardsize -- the command fails if the board size requested is different than the
expected value set at compile time.

kill dead groups; when answering this command it will always mark all stones as
alive, not identifying life in seki.
